Dual Wheel Motion Controller

This system allows the user two control a two wheeled vehicle in various kinds of motion. The system consists of the following electronics:
-Arduino Uno microcontroller board
-MC33926 dual motor driver board from Pololu
-Dual LS7366R Quadrature Encoder Buffer from SuperDroid Robots
These may be connected together along with appropriately sized motors and quaderature encoders. Wiring diagrams will be included later. When the firmware is loaded on the Arduino Uno and plugged into a computer, the system may be controlled with a MATLAB interface.


This project is being developed by the TAs for MIT's 2.12/2.120 Introduction to Robotics.
